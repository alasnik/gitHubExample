//Create a script with two variables, each assigned to a number. Add them together and output the result to the console. Now do the same with two strings.

var x = 2
var y = 6

console.log (x+y)

var z = 2+8-3
var t = 2*6-3

console.log (z+t)

console.log (x+y+z+t)





//Write a script that checks if a variable is less than 100. If it is, alert the user that their variable is less than 100. 
//If it is not alert the user of what the value was and that it was greater than 100.

for (var i=0; i<=100; i++) {

 	if (i <= 100) {
 		console.log ("amount below 100")
 	}

 	else {
 		console.log	("amount above 100")
 	}

 	console.log(i)
}



//Write a similar script to check if a string stored in a variable is the same as another string.

var x  = "hi"

is x equal to "ciao"?

if (x === "ciao") {
	console.log	("this is bad")
